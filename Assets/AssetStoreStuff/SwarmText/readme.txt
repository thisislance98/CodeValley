Version: 1.0

Change Log:
	v1.0 (2011/11/29): Initial Release
	
Font Textures: Font textures are located in => SwarmText/Art/Fonts/. These fonts are 
not linked to materials as they only need to be linked to the SwarmText component. You 
can use 'Unity Font Mapper' (http://loewald.com/unity/unityfontmapper.zip) to create 
new font textures. 

Swarm Text is a simple particle based text display. Once a font is selected particles 
will gravitate towards their desired position. Large groups of particles following 
this behavior give the desired text display effect.

Almost all text properties (Font, Font Size, Population, Speed, etc...) can be changed 
in real time. Particles will react to these changes as they are made.
