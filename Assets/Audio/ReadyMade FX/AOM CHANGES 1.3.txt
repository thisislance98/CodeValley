CHANGES MADE FOR ACTS OF MAGIC 1.3

This file documents changes made for ACTS OF MAGIC 1.3 


GENERAL

* Price increased to reflect added Sparks of the Tempest content now that it has audio.


ACTS OF MAGIC

* Complete set of audio effects added to Sparks of the Tempest and its secondary effects
   - Sounds created by Chris Kukla (http://chriskukla.com)
   
* Edited or added info box effect descriptions for Sparks of the Tempest and related isolated effects
   - primarily to credit Chris Kukla for his audio work.
   
* Renamed some Prefab folders to Prefab


RMFX FRAMEWORK

* Bug fixes
   - fixed problem with EffectGroupRMFX TraverseAndCallOnContinue() method pertaining to inactive nodes. 
   
* Class Improvements
   - RMFXCore: added Object Of Interest tracking


RMFX DEMO

* Character Responders
   - Made some changes to SOTT CastingResponder and BHAR Responder for Contruction Worker and Mage Robot to support the
     cinema camera used to better demo Sparks of the Tempest spell.


KNOWN PROBLEMS

* SelectionManager RolloverLight and Deferred Lighting
   - The selection system highlights objects using a special Rollover directional light that only lights objects in the
     Rollover layer. With Deferred Lighting, lights cannot exclude more than 4 layers, and this makes the current highlighting
     solution unsuitable for Deferred Lighting unless you are using a very small number of layers. If you run the Acts of Magic
     demo scenes with Deferred Lighting enabled, you will likely get the message:
         "Warning: Too many layers used to exclude objects from lighting."
     The warning as well as excess lighting in the scene can be avoided by removing the RolloverLight, but this will also
     turn off the selection system's rollover highlighting.
